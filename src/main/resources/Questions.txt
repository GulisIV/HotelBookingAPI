What to do with previous reservations when hotel work time is changed?
Should we delete them or inform users somehow?

As idea:
do some priority of reservation (HIGH, MIDDLE, LOW).
HIGH for RoomBreaks;
MIDDLE for ADMIN (if he want to book room for special person it will override LOW priority reservations)
LOW for USERs
